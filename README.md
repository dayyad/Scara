1. Derive the appropriate direct and inverse kinematic equations for your
arm. Create a list of test cases that your model and final code must meet
(i.e. avoiding singularities)</br></br>
2. Implement your equations using the framework java simulation for your
arm that has been provided. Test how well your model code performs
against the requirements defined in the lab script and make any necessary
improvements.</br></br>
3. Deploy the code from your simulation onto hardware. Show that it passes
all necessary test cases. Arm performance in drawing pictures judged by
Arthur.
